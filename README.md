E-commerce Business  Data Analytics and Prediction with Machine Learning

Project Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of the overall business activity for an e-commerce platform over time. This project focuses on identifying key insights across several crucial areas, including sales trends, product performance, distribution center efficiency, customer behavior, and website activity. These insights will be used to make data-driven recommendations to enhance future business operations and decision-making.

Scope of the Study:

Sales Progression: Analyze sales performance trends over time, focusing on revenue, seasonal fluctuations, and customer purchasing behavior. This analysis will identify peak periods and areas for growth.

Product Performance: Evaluate the success of different products in the e-commerce catalog by tracking metrics such as sales volume, revenue contribution, and customer reviews. Products will be categorized based on performance to identify top-sellers and underperformers.

Distribution Center Performance: Assess the efficiency of distribution centers by evaluating metrics like order processing times, delivery accuracy, and geographical coverage. This will help in identifying bottlenecks and areas where operational efficiency can be improved.

Customer Behavior Analysis: Study customer purchasing patterns, including average order values, repeat purchases, and customer segmentation. Understanding these behaviors will help in crafting strategies for better customer retention and engagement.

Website Activity: Analyze website traffic and user behavior to understand how visitors interact with the platform. Metrics like page views, bounce rates, and conversion rates will be explored to optimize the user experience and enhance conversion rates.

Tech Stack:

SQL: Utilized for querying the e-commerce database to extract raw transactional, product, and customer data. SQL is also used to manage large datasets and perform complex joins and aggregations.
Python: Employed for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying statistical models. Key libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are leveraged for visualizing trends.
Tableau: Used to create interactive dashboards that present key insights and trends discovered in the analysis. The dashboards allow stakeholders to explore data dynamically, filter metrics, and make data-driven decisions.
Deliverables:

A comprehensive report summarizing the findings from the analysis, including visualizations and interpretations of key business metrics.
An interactive Tableau dashboard that provides real-time insights into sales performance, product success, and operational efficiency.
Actionable recommendations to optimize business operations, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall performance based on data-driven insights.
This project aims to provide a holistic understanding of the e-commerce platformâ€™s operational strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately helping the business scale and succeed in a competitive market.
